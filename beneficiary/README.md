# Implementation Progress Report

I have implemented the Beneficiary Manager service with all core functionalities as requested. The service is ready for ONEST protocol integration.

## Completed Features ✅

### API Endpoints

- `GET /schemes` - Fetch schemes with filtering support
- `POST /applications` - Submit applications with credentials
- `GET /status` - Track application status

### Core Implementation

- PostgreSQL database integration with migrations
- Configuration management using environment variables
- Structured logging with different levels
- Input validation and error handling
- Unit tests with mocks
- Docker containerization

### Integration-Ready Features
- Clean interface-based design for easy protocol integration
- Stateless service architecture
- Configurable database connection pooling
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Comprehensive error types
- Request/response logging

## Next Steps
- [ ] Integrate with ONEST financial support protocol
  - Implement protocol client
  - Add protocol-specific validation
  - Map local models to protocol formats
  - Handle protocol-specific errors

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure
3. Run `docker-compose up`

## Testing
Run tests with:
```
go test ./...
```

## Docker Containerization
Build and run with: 
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Looking forward to guidance on ONEST protocol integration specifications to complete the implementation.
